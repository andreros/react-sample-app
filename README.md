React Sample Application

## Proposed Solution

A React sample application to help bootstrap new React projects in a simple and fast way. This application can also be considered a boilerplate application with all the preferred development configurations and tools in place and ready to use.

## Application Tech Stack

- `React` framework (with Typescript) for the overall application development;
- `Typescript` coding language;
- `SASS` to build the needed application styles;
- `Axios` to communicate with the backend API;
- `DotEnv` to load project environment variables;
- `Webpack` to bundle the application and serve it in development mode;

## Installation and platform bootstrap

From the project root folder, please execute the following commands in a terminal window:

```
npm i
npm start
```
